        <p>I'll give any interview or information regarding Bitcoin; we just need help.</p>
        <h3>The Story of Bitcoin and the Struggles of Ordinary People</h3>
        <p>It all started with the idea of eCash, a peer-to-peer internet payment system. SHA256 was the algorithm chosen, but it was untested in real-world scenarios. Initially, the concept seemed exceptional—it allowed you to send digital cash almost instantly over the internet. Word spread quickly. It began with a group of curious individuals as a hobby. With curiosity came excitement, questions, discussions, and stories. As Bitcoin's community grew, more and more attention and ideas poured in. Unlike most things in this world, there was no boss of Bitcoin. Initially, the motto was "one CPU, one vote," but as the network grew, this changed, and a darkness formed over Bitcoin: GPU and ASIC miners.</p>
        
        <p>For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin was completely untested in a real-world application. Before Bitcoin, there was eCash by David Chaum, known as Cyberbucks, which was a brilliant concept. I believe he encountered the same network issues and questions I personally had. Those with the most hash power can mine more blocks, thus taking over the network, putting those mining with CPU power at a huge disadvantage. The issue we both faced is that you can create something open source, but large entities can push you out faster than you could ever imagine. A "PE" is a Planet Eater—corporations with large-scale mining farms and vast resources to dominate networks, leaving the "one CPU, one vote" philosophy behind and your average person in the dust.</p>
        
        <p>I warned about this. My concept was untested as a SHA256 system. Now, it’s rare to hit a Bitcoin block, and the main reason why Bitcoin is stuck at a "low" price of $60k is due to mining farms. Let me explain: If I have 200 EH/s and the network is 600 EH/s, I have the ability to hit about one-third of the blocks, thus acquiring 200,000 Bitcoin, which I can then sell on exchanges, driving the price back down. It’s like you’re treading water while I constantly push your head down, only letting you up for air occasionally, just to mess with you. Corporations, the Bitcointalk community, and governments caught on to this great scheme. SHA256 was never tested in real-world applications or scenarios until the last 15 years. My issue is not with being cut out, silenced, and burned. My issue is that they are messing with middle-class and regular people trying to get involved in Bitcoin.</p>

        <h3>Part 2: The Scam</h3>
        <p>You have a brilliant idea to save the world with your new coin, but you're new to the crypto game. You talk to a bunch of people, and they suggest you do a fork of a SHA256 coin—basically Bitcoin—and rebrand it. Your idea is so amazing that you bet it all, every bit of your money. You’re so excited that you post it on Bitcointalk.org. Bitcointalk.org—the dream crushers. They have hero badges and all sorts of badges earned by those who are really the best scammers. You think they’re truly heroes, and they tell you to post your links, make an announcement on the altcoin page; sometimes they even "help you" by moving it there for you. Awe, that’s nice, isn’t it?</p>
        
        <p>Next, they tell you that you need a website. They have people for that. Where’s the source code? They have people for that too. Then they ask you how to download the wallet. A few comments in, they start calling it a "shitcoin" or "scam" to make you mad, saying it’s just another rip-off, labeling you a scammer. They never focus on the project's goals or what you are trying to accomplish, for many reasons. The real reason is to leave you so confused and committed that they can mine you out of your own project using a 51% attack on the network, take all the mined coins, and sell them on exchanges.</p>
        
        <p>This is the fun part: the exchange listings! Now, after they’ve completely messed you up, they want you to be more social, so they help you set up Discord and Telegram. You drop your new thread on Bitcointalk.org, and suddenly, so many people start joining! OMG, it’s so great—300 people in your new Discord channel. WOW!!! Little do you know, they’ve just set you up, and they’re ready for their business model to go into effect. You’ll start getting all these DMs—direct messages—from people so in love with your idea and project that they want to get involved, especially with the listings on exchanges, marketing, website development, and they’ll even do a little work for free or for a really good price! Yeah, right—that’s the scam.</p>

        <p>Then they say: "Oh, we’ll get you a listing, it’s so easy!" or "We can put you on this exchange if you just pay me a small fee." You pay that fee, and boom, you’re listed! But the price only stays at $0.01 because nobody believes you. They’re just waiting to see what happens next. Meanwhile, they have all your coins, and you’re stuck wondering why it isn’t working. So they pump, then dump, and you’re left out in the cold.</p>
